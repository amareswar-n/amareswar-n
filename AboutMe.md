Where it all began and how I got here, now... # ABOUT

I’m a Electrical Engineer by Education and a software Developer by Profession, who loves Computers than anything
(my love language is Physical Touch, so I’m aaaaall for a tight squeeze), 
hopping on a flight to anywhere, and teaching people like you how to live an abundant and limitless life.
