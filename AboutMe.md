Where it all began and how I got here, now... # ABOUT

I’m a Electrical Engineer by Education and a software Developer by Profession, who loves Computers than anything
(my love language is Physical Touch, so I’m aaaaall for a tight squeeze), 
hopping on a flight to anywhere, and teaching people like you how to live an abundant and limitless life.

## If you’ve made it this far… thank you.

Seriously, I deeply value every relationship I’ve been lucky enough to build from this blog.

My strengths lie in helping readers to become [<em>DATA LITERATE</em>](https://github.com/amareswar-n/amareswar-n/edit/main/AboutMe.md "Data is only as useful as your ability to understand it correctly, and a team that understands data makes better data-driven decisions."). So if you’re here for the same, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Shoot me an email at amareswar.n@gmail.com if you have questions, I’d love to hear from you.

If you’re looking for something to read, start in [MyUNIVERSITY](https://github.com/amareswar-n/MyUniversity) and dive deep today.
