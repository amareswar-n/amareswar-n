### Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is AmAr, and this is the "About Me" stuff...
      I am a self-taught student of programming and spend much of my time on building the skillset to learn as much as I can. There have been many good people who have assited me in learning this craft, and I try to pay that forward by helping others who may be newer than I. I am currently working ðŸ”­ as a **DATA ENGINEER** with TCS. You can find me ðŸ“« on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amareswar/).
