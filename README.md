## About Me 
 
<p>I always had an interest in technology from a very early age, because of my passion for watching sci-fi movies and TV series; stories that were based on or soaked in computers, robots, spaceships with a central intelligence units or newely termed as “AI”. I was first introduced to computer in school with LOGO programming language and was fascinated to draw a TRIANGLE and obsessed with the ability to control the cursor through programming/coding. The feeling of finishing the code of a certain application, and watching the computer “live” in the way you pre-determined it is unbelievable. <p/> 
 <p>
 It was my first year at graduation, when I saw the first "hello world!" C program, well it looked quite obvious to me and I started loving coding. I did my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering but my love towards computers has never faded. It has always fascinated me how I can reuse a piece of silicon in so many ways. I've had a huge quench of knowledge when I saw the first computer, and that quench has been heavily increased over time. There's nothing boring about it, lot of theory to start obviously, but almost everything can be tested with a simple computer by hand. There's no limit what can be done with a computer, and above all, it never quits. <p /> 
 
Computer has been my first love, and I can guarantee will accompany me to heaven (or hell, whatever!), and it still amazes me everyday when I switch on my laptop, thinking about the things that are happening almost instantaneously inside the chasis. <br /> 

It is a work of art, indeed. <br /> 
 
I am a firm believer in “⚡ **You'll never know everything about anything, especially something you love.** ⚡” and spend much of the time skilling, reskilling & [upskilling](https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/upskill-or-be-left-behind/articleshow/72705220.cms) my skills. There have been many good people who have assited me in learning this craft, and I try to pay that forward by helping others who may be newer than I.
