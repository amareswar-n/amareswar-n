## About Me,  
 
I always had an interest in technology from a very early age, because of my passion for watching sci-fi movies and TV series; stories that were based on or soaked in computers, robots, spaceships with a central intelligence units or newely termed as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù. I was first introduced to computer in school with LOGO programming language and was fascinated to draw a TRIANGLE and obsessed with the ability to control the cursor through programming/coding. The feeling of finishing the code of a certain application, and watching the computer ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the way you pre-determined it is unbelievable. It was my first year at graduation, when I saw the first "hello world!" C program, well it looked quite obvious to me and I started loving coding. I did my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering but my love towards computers has never faded. It has always fascinated me how I can reuse a piece of silicon in so many ways. I've had a huge quench of knowledge when I saw the first computer, and that quench has been heavily increased over time. There's nothing boring in it. There's a lot of theory obviously, but almost everything can be tested with a simple computer by hand. There's no limit what can be done with a computer, and above all, it never quits.
 
Computer has been my first love, and the one true love that I can guarantee will accompany me to heaven (or hell, whatever!), and it still amazes me everyday when I switch on my laptop, thinking about the things that are happening almost instantaneously inside the chasis.

It is a work of art, indeed.
 
I am a firm believer in ‚Äú**You'll never know everything about anything, especially something you love.**‚Äù  "**Lifelong Learning**" and spend much of the time skilling, reskilling & [upskilling](https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/upskill-or-be-left-behind/articleshow/72705220.cms) my Technical skills. There have been many good people who have assited me in learning this craft, and I try to pay that forward by helping others who may be newer than me.
